* Diclofenac, an antibiotic used to make domestic lives easier is eventually leading to Parsis cremating their dead instead of hanging them to be eaten by vultures, their traditional way of disposing dead bodies.
* This is because, the population of vultures that eat off these bodies has drastically reduced because of liver diseases caused by them feeding on cows who have been treated with diclofenac.
* The seen effect of using the antibiotic was that the cattle got better. However, the unseen effect and almost non-guessable effect was that Parsis would cremate their dead instead of hanging them to be eaten by vultures.
